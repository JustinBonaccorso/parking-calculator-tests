Selenium Tests written in JAVA to test the parking calculator

Test Cases are written in Java and uploaded indopendently. 
A testing suite was also in the works, but I resisted due to the nature of Test Case #2 and the 'excitment' that it provided.
As these tests are relatively straight forward I attempted to make the testing reflect the basic nature of the requirements.
While writing my test cases I attempted to account for each different Parking option, as well as an unusual duration. 
In creating these I mainly utilized: Selenium IDE/WebDriver, XCode, Firefox, FireBug, GitHub, Eclipse
